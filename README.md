# nonlinearFEA_codes
Python codes written for the course ME597: Non-linear finite element methods at Purdue University, West lafayette

These codes are a subset of the homework submissions for ME597
Note that they have been modified as compared to the original course submissions, incorporating instructor feedback
I have tried ensure that the codes are free of bugs. However, please feel free to reach out to me should you encounter any while making use of them.
